# User Story: SEC-006 - Implement API Versioning Security

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a security engineer, I want to implement API versioning security so that APIs are protected against version-specific vulnerabilities, ensure secure header handling, and maintain backward compatibility for existing consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Version-specific validation is enforced for all API endpoints based on the requested version
- [ ] Secure header handling is implemented for API version identification and validation
- [ ] Backward compatibility is maintained for existing API consumers without breaking changes
- [ ] Proper error responses are provided for unsupported or invalid API versions
- [ ] Security policies are applied consistently across all API versions

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Design API versioning security framework
     1. - [ ] Define version identification mechanisms (headers, URL paths, query parameters)
     2. - [ ] Design validation rules for each API version
     3. - [ ] Plan secure header handling and validation

2. - [ ] Implement version-specific validation
     1. - [ ] Create middleware for version detection and validation
     2. - [ ] Add version-specific request validation logic
     3. - [ ] Implement error handling for invalid versions

3. - [ ] Secure header handling
     1. - [ ] Implement secure header parsing and validation
     2. - [ ] Add security checks for version headers
     3. - [ ] Ensure headers are sanitized and validated

4. - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
     1. - [ ] Test existing API consumers for compatibility
     2. - [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for older versions
     3. - [ ] Update documentation for version changes

5. - [ ] Test implementation
     1. - [ ] Test version-specific validation with various scenarios
     2. - [ ] Verify secure header handling under different conditions
     3. - [ ] Confirm backward compatibility with existing integrations

6. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document API versioning security policies
     2. - [ ] Update API documentation with version requirements
     3. - [ ] Add developer notes on versioning implementation

## Estimation: 5 story points

Story Points: 5 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use middleware to intercept and validate API version headers
- Implement version mapping for different endpoints
- Ensure security headers like Content-Type and Accept are validated
- Consider using semantic versioning for API versions
- Add logging for version-related security events
