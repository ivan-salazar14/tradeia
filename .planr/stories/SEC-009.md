# User Story: SEC-009 - Implement Security Monitoring and Alerting

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a security engineer, I want to implement security monitoring and alerting so that security events are monitored in real-time, automated alerts are generated for suspicious activities, and incident response capabilities are established to handle security breaches effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Real-time security event monitoring is implemented to continuously track system activities, user behaviors, and potential threats
- [ ] Automated alerts are configured to notify security teams immediately when security events or anomalies are detected
- [ ] Incident response capabilities are established, including predefined response procedures, escalation paths, and integration with incident management systems
- [ ] Security monitoring covers key areas such as authentication attempts, data access patterns, network traffic, and system integrity
- [ ] Alerting system supports customizable thresholds, severity levels, and notification channels (email, SMS, Slack, etc.)
- [ ] Incident response workflows include automated containment actions, evidence collection, and post-incident analysis

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Design monitoring framework
     1. - [ ] Define security events and metrics to monitor
     2. - [ ] Establish monitoring architecture and data collection points
     3. - [ ] Design alert rules and thresholds

2. - [ ] Implement real-time monitoring
     1. - [ ] Integrate logging and monitoring tools (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus)
     2. - [ ] Configure event collection from application logs, system logs, and network traffic
     3. - [ ] Set up real-time data processing and anomaly detection

3. - [ ] Implement automated alerting
     1. - [ ] Configure alert rules based on security policies
     2. - [ ] Integrate with notification services and channels
     3. - [ ] Implement alert prioritization and deduplication

4. - [ ] Establish incident response capabilities
     1. - [ ] Define incident response procedures and playbooks
     2. - [ ] Implement automated response actions (e.g., blocking IPs, quarantining systems)
     3. - [ ] Integrate with incident management platforms (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira)

5. - [ ] Test monitoring and alerting system
     1. - [ ] Validate event detection accuracy and coverage
     2. - [ ] Test alert generation and delivery
     3. - [ ] Simulate security incidents and verify response workflows

6. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document monitoring configuration and alert rules
     2. - [ ] Create incident response runbooks
     3. - [ ] Update security policies with monitoring requirements

## Estimation: 5 story points

Story Points: 5 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use industry-standard monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM systems, intrusion detection systems)
- Ensure monitoring complies with privacy regulations and data protection standards
- Implement scalable monitoring that can handle high-volume event data
- Consider integration with existing security tools and infrastructure
- Include performance monitoring to avoid impact on system operations
