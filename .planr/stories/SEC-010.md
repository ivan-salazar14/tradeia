# User Story: SEC-010 - Implement Rate Limit Monitoring

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a system administrator, I want to implement rate limit monitoring so that rate limit violations are tracked effectively, an analytics dashboard provides insights into usage patterns, and proactive scaling alerts prevent service degradation during high traffic periods.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Rate limit violations are tracked and logged with detailed information including user ID, endpoint, timestamp, and violation type
- [ ] Analytics dashboard displays real-time and historical rate limit metrics, including violation trends, top offending users, and endpoint usage patterns
- [ ] Proactive scaling alerts are triggered when rate limits approach thresholds, enabling automatic or manual scaling actions to maintain service availability
- [ ] Monitoring system integrates with existing logging and alerting infrastructure
- [ ] Dashboard supports filtering and visualization of rate limit data by time range, user, and endpoint
- [ ] Alerting system supports configurable thresholds and multiple notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Design rate limit monitoring architecture
     1. - [ ] Define metrics and data points to track for rate limiting
     2. - [ ] Design database schema for storing rate limit events and analytics
     3. - [ ] Establish monitoring integration points with existing rate limiting middleware

2. - [ ] Implement violation tracking
     1. - [ ] Create logging mechanism for rate limit violations
     2. - [ ] Implement data collection from rate limiting components
     3. - [ ] Set up data aggregation and processing pipeline

3. - [ ] Build analytics dashboard
     1. - [ ] Design dashboard UI components for rate limit metrics
     2. - [ ] Implement data visualization charts and graphs
     3. - [ ] Add filtering and time-range selection capabilities

4. - [ ] Implement proactive scaling alerts
     1. - [ ] Define alert thresholds and conditions
     2. - [ ] Integrate with alerting and notification services
     3. - [ ] Implement auto-scaling triggers if applicable

5. - [ ] Test monitoring system
     1. - [ ] Validate violation tracking accuracy
     2. - [ ] Test dashboard functionality and data accuracy
     3. - [ ] Simulate high-traffic scenarios to verify alerts and scaling

6. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document monitoring configuration and alert settings
     2. - [ ] Create user guide for analytics dashboard
     3. - [ ] Update operational procedures for rate limit management

## Estimation: 3 story points

Story Points: 3 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Ensure monitoring adds minimal performance overhead to rate limiting operations
- Consider data retention policies for rate limit logs and analytics
- Implement secure access controls for the analytics dashboard
- Support both real-time and batch processing for analytics data
- Include health checks for monitoring system components
