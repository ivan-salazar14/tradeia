# User Story: SEC-001 - Standardize Security Middleware Application

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a developer, I want to standardize security middleware across all API routes so that security is consistently applied and maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] All API routes use the applySecurityMiddleware function
- [ ] Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.) are applied to all API responses
- [ ] Rate limiting is enforced on all API routes with appropriate limits
- [ ] CORS headers are consistently applied across all routes
- [ ] Input sanitization functions are used where user input is processed
- [ ] No API route bypasses the security middleware implementation
- [ ] Authentication routes handle security middleware appropriately without conflicts

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Audit existing API routes
   1. - [ ] Identify all API route files in /api directory
   2. - [ ] Document which routes currently use applySecurityMiddleware
   3. - [ ] Document which routes have custom security implementations
   4. - [ ] Identify routes that require special handling (auth routes, health checks)

2. - [ ] Update API routes to use applySecurityMiddleware
   1. - [ ] Update routes that don't use security middleware (auth/login, backtest, etc.)
   2. - [ ] Ensure authentication logic works with security middleware
   3. - [ ] Handle special cases like health endpoints that may need different rate limits
   4. - [ ] Update route handlers to work with the middleware wrapper pattern

3. - [ ] Test security implementation
   1. - [ ] Test rate limiting across all routes
   2. - [ ] Verify security headers are present in responses
   3. - [ ] Test CORS functionality
   4. - [ ] Ensure authentication still works properly
   5. - [ ] Test error handling with security middleware

4. - [ ] Update documentation and code comments
   1. - [ ] Document the security middleware usage in API routes
   2. - [ ] Update any relevant README or API documentation
   3. - [ ] Add comments explaining security middleware integration

## Estimation: 8 story points

Story Points: 8 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- The applySecurityMiddleware function combines rate limiting, security headers, and CORS handling
- Current implementation shows SignalsService uses it, but routes like auth/login and backtest have custom implementations
- Need to ensure that routes requiring authentication (like backtest with Bearer tokens) still validate auth properly
- Health check endpoints (/api/health) may need different rate limiting or be excluded
- Consider creating a helper function for routes that need both security middleware and custom auth logic

## Chat Command Log:

- User requested creation of user story for standardizing security middleware across API routes
- Used story template from plan.md
- Included comprehensive acceptance criteria and task breakdown based on current codebase analysis
