# User Story: US-014 - API Token Management for Signals Generation API

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a registered user, I want to securely manage API tokens for connecting to the signals generation API so that I can receive trading signals from external providers. The token generation should be integrated with the existing login endpoint to ensure proper authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Users can generate API tokens for signals generation API after successful login
- [ ] API tokens are securely stored and encrypted
- [ ] Users can view, regenerate, and revoke their API tokens
- [ ] Token permissions can be configured (read-only, execute trades, etc.)
- [ ] Token usage is tracked and monitored
- [ ] Token expiration and rotation policies are enforced
- [ ] Token generation is integrated with the existing login endpoint (API-002)

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Token Management Interface
   1. - [ ] Create token generation UI integrated with login flow
   2. - [ ] Design token listing and management dashboard
   3. - [ ] Implement token permission configuration
   4. - [ ] Add token usage statistics display
   5. - [ ] Add token generation option in user profile section

2. - [ ] Token API Implementation
   1. - [ ] Extend login endpoint (API-002) to support token generation
   2. - [ ] Create API endpoint for token generation
   3. - [ ] Implement token validation and verification
   4. - [ ] Add token revocation endpoint
   5. - [ ] Create token refresh mechanism

3. - [ ] Token Security
   1. - [ ] Implement secure token storage in Supabase
   2. - [ ] Add token encryption and hashing
   3. - [ ] Create token rotation policies
   4. - [ ] Implement token usage monitoring
   5. - [ ] Add rate limiting for token generation requests

4. - [ ] Token Documentation
   1. - [ ] Create API documentation for token usage
   2. - [ ] Add token integration examples
   3. - [ ] Create security best practices guide
   4. - [ ] Implement token usage tutorials
   5. - [ ] Document login-token generation flow

## Estimation: 4 story points

Story Points: 4 SP (4 days of Human Development = 40 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use JWT for token implementation with appropriate expiration
- Store only token hashes in the database, never raw tokens
- Implement rate limiting for token generation and usage
- Add comprehensive logging for all token operations
- Ensure clear error messages for token-related issues
- Consider implementing OAuth 2.0 for more advanced integrations
- Integrate token generation with the existing login endpoint (API-002) to leverage current authentication flow
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and token validation
- Consider different token scopes based on user subscription plans (if applicable)
- Implement token generation as part of the user profile management
- Follow the structure in the existing Postman collection for API endpoints design
- Ensure tokens have appropriate CORS settings for secure cross-origin requests
