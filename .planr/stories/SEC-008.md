# User Story: SEC-008 - Establish Regular Security Audits

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a security engineer, I want to establish regular security audits so that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed proactively, ensuring the system remains secure and compliant with security standards.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Automated security scanning is implemented and runs regularly (e.g., daily/weekly) to detect code vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security issues
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability checks are automated to scan for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and packages
- [ ] Audit scheduling is established with defined frequencies, responsible parties, and reporting mechanisms for security audits
- [ ] Security audit results are documented and tracked with remediation plans for identified issues
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline for continuous security scanning during development and deployment

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Design audit framework
     1. - [ ] Define audit types and frequencies (code scanning, dependency checks, infrastructure audits)
     2. - [ ] Establish audit scheduling and notification system
     3. - [ ] Design reporting and tracking mechanisms for audit results

2. - [ ] Implement automated security scanning
     1. - [ ] Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools
     2. - [ ] Configure automated code scanning in CI/CD pipeline
     3. - [ ] Set up regular scanning schedules and alerting

3. - [ ] Implement dependency vulnerability checks
     1. - [ ] Integrate software composition analysis (SCA) tools
     2. - [ ] Configure automated dependency scanning
     3. - [ ] Implement vulnerability remediation workflows

4. - [ ] Establish audit scheduling system
     1. - [ ] Create audit calendar and scheduling logic
     2. - [ ] Implement audit assignment and tracking
     3. - [ ] Set up automated reminders and escalation procedures

5. - [ ] Test audit implementation
     1. - [ ] Validate scanning accuracy and coverage
     2. - [ ] Test audit scheduling and notification systems
     3. - [ ] Verify integration with existing development workflows

6. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document audit procedures and schedules
     2. - [ ] Update security policies with audit requirements
     3. - [ ] Create runbooks for audit execution and remediation

## Estimation: 5 story points

Story Points: 5 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use industry-standard security scanning tools (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Snyk)
- Ensure scans run in non-production environments to avoid performance impact
- Implement severity-based alerting and prioritization
- Consider compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.) for audit scope
- Integrate with existing monitoring and alerting systems
