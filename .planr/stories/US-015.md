# User Story: US-015 - Signals Generation API Integration

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a registered user, I want the application to integrate with external signals generation APIs so that I can receive and act on trading signals from professional providers.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Application can connect to external signals generation APIs
- [ ] Signals are received in real-time and processed
- [ ] Signal data is normalized to a standard format regardless of source
- [ ] Signal validation and quality checks are performed
- [ ] Failed API connections are gracefully handled with appropriate user notifications
- [ ] Signal source is clearly identified in the user interface

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] API Integration Framework
   1. - [ ] Create API connector service
   2. - [ ] Implement API authentication with tokens
   3. - [ ] Add connection health monitoring
   4. - [ ] Create API fallback mechanisms

2. - [ ] Signal Processing
   1. - [ ] Implement signal data normalization
   2. - [ ] Create signal validation rules
   3. - [ ] Add signal enrichment with additional data
   4. - [ ] Implement signal priority and categorization

3. - [ ] Real-time Signal Handling
   1. - [ ] Create WebSocket connections for real-time signals
   2. - [ ] Implement signal queuing for high volume periods
   3. - [ ] Add signal deduplication logic
   4. - [ ] Create signal delivery confirmation

4. - [ ] Signal Provider Management
   1. - [ ] Create provider configuration interface
   2. - [ ] Implement provider-specific settings
   3. - [ ] Add provider performance tracking
   4. - [ ] Create provider reliability metrics

## Estimation: 5 story points

Story Points: 5 SP (5 days of Human Development = 50 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use adapter pattern to support multiple signal providers with different APIs
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for API resilience
- Add comprehensive logging for all API interactions
- Consider implementing a signal cache for offline access
- Use WebSockets for real-time signal delivery when available
- Fall back to polling when WebSockets aren't supported
