# User Story: SEC-003 - Implement Production-Grade Rate Limiting

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a system administrator, I want to implement production-grade rate limiting so that API endpoints are protected against abuse, ensuring fair usage and maintaining system stability under high load.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Redis-based rate limiting is implemented for all API endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting supports distributed storage across multiple instances
- [ ] Proper monitoring and alerting for rate limit violations is in place
- [ ] Rate limits are configurable per endpoint and user tier
- [ ] Rate limiting includes sliding window algorithms for accurate enforcement
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms exist when Redis is unavailable
- [ ] Rate limit headers are returned in API responses (X-RateLimit-*)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards display rate limiting metrics and violations

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Set up Redis infrastructure
     1. - [ ] Configure Redis cluster for distributed storage
     2. - [ ] Implement Redis connection pooling
     3. - [ ] Add Redis health checks and failover handling

2. - [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
     1. - [ ] Create rate limiting service using Redis
     2. - [ ] Implement sliding window rate limiting algorithm
     3. - [ ] Add configurable rate limits per endpoint
     4. - [ ] Integrate middleware into API routes

3. - [ ] Add monitoring and alerting
     1. - [ ] Implement metrics collection for rate limiting events
     2. - [ ] Set up alerting for rate limit violations
     3. - [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
     4. - [ ] Add logging for rate limiting decisions

4. - [ ] Test rate limiting implementation
     1. - [ ] Test rate limiting under various load conditions
     2. - [ ] Verify distributed behavior across multiple instances
     3. - [ ] Test Redis failover scenarios
     4. - [ ] Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

5. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document rate limiting configuration
     2. - [ ] Update API documentation with rate limit information
     3. - [ ] Add developer notes on rate limiting usage

## Estimation: 12 story points

Story Points: 12 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use Redis for distributed rate limiting to handle horizontal scaling
- Implement sliding window algorithm for more accurate rate limiting than fixed windows
- Consider using libraries like 'rate-limiter-flexible' or 'express-rate-limit' with Redis store
- Ensure rate limits are configurable via environment variables
- Monitor rate limiting metrics using existing monitoring stack
- Handle Redis connection failures gracefully with local in-memory fallback
