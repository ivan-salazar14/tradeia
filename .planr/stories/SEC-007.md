# User Story: SEC-007 - Implement Comprehensive Request Logging

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a security engineer, I want to implement comprehensive request logging so that all incoming requests are logged for audit purposes, security events are tracked, and logs can be analyzed for security insights and compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] All incoming requests are logged with relevant details (timestamp, IP, user agent, endpoint, request method, response status)
- [ ] Audit logging captures user actions and system events for compliance requirements
- [ ] Security event tracking identifies and logs suspicious activities (failed logins, unauthorized access attempts, rate limiting triggers)
- [ ] Log analysis capabilities include filtering, searching, and alerting on security-related events
- [ ] Logs are securely stored and protected from tampering
- [ ] Performance impact of logging is minimal and configurable

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Design logging framework
     1. - [ ] Define log data structure and fields to capture
     2. - [ ] Design security event classification and alerting rules
     3. - [ ] Plan log storage and retention policies

2. - [ ] Implement request logging middleware
     1. - [ ] Create middleware to intercept and log all requests
     2. - [ ] Add structured logging with JSON format
     3. - [ ] Implement log sanitization to prevent sensitive data exposure

3. - [ ] Security event tracking
     1. - [ ] Define security event types and triggers
     2. - [ ] Implement event detection logic
     3. - [ ] Add correlation IDs for tracking related events

4. - [ ] Log analysis capabilities
     1. - [ ] Implement log querying and filtering
     2. - [ ] Add real-time alerting for security events
     3. - [ ] Create dashboards for log visualization

5. - [ ] Test implementation
     1. - [ ] Test logging under various load conditions
     2. - [ ] Verify security event detection accuracy
     3. - [ ] Validate log analysis features

6. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document logging policies and procedures
     2. - [ ] Update security guidelines with logging requirements
     3. - [ ] Add developer notes on logging implementation

## Estimation: 5 story points

Story Points: 5 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use structured logging libraries for consistent format
- Implement log rotation and compression for storage efficiency
- Ensure logs are encrypted at rest and in transit
- Consider integrating with SIEM systems for advanced analysis
- Add configurable log levels for different environments

## Chat Command Log:

- User requested creation of user story for comprehensive request logging
- Included acceptance criteria for audit logging, security event tracking, and log analysis capabilities
- Used story template from plan.md with comprehensive task breakdown
