# User Story: SEC-002 - Implement Comprehensive Joi Validation

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a developer, I want to implement comprehensive Joi validation across all API endpoints so that manual validation is replaced with robust, schema-based validation to ensure data integrity and security.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] All API endpoints use Joi schemas for request validation
- [ ] Manual validation logic is removed from route handlers
- [ ] Joi schemas are defined for all input types (body, query, params)
- [ ] Validation errors return consistent, user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Schema validation includes type checking, required fields, and custom validations
- [ ] No API endpoint bypasses Joi validation implementation
- [ ] Authentication and authorization routes handle validation appropriately

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Audit existing validation implementations
    1. - [ ] Identify all API route files in /api directory
    2. - [ ] Document current manual validation patterns
    3. - [ ] Identify routes with no validation or incomplete validation
    4. - [ ] Analyze validation requirements for each endpoint

2. - [ ] Create Joi validation schemas
    1. - [ ] Define schemas for common data types (user input, IDs, dates, etc.)
    2. - [ ] Create endpoint-specific schemas for request bodies and parameters
    3. - [ ] Implement custom validation rules where needed
    4. - [ ] Organize schemas in a reusable validation library

3. - [ ] Integrate Joi validation into API routes
    1. - [ ] Replace manual validation in route handlers
    2. - [ ] Apply schemas to all request types (POST bodies, GET params, etc.)
    3. - [ ] Handle validation errors with proper error responses
    4. - [ ] Ensure validation works with existing middleware

4. - [ ] Test validation implementation
    1. - [ ] Test valid and invalid inputs across all endpoints
    2. - [ ] Verify error messages are clear and consistent
    3. - [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
    4. - [ ] Ensure existing functionality still works with new validation

5. - [ ] Update documentation and code comments
    1. - [ ] Document Joi schema usage in API routes
    2. - [ ] Update API documentation with validation requirements
    3. - [ ] Add comments explaining validation logic

## Estimation: 10 story points

Story Points: 10 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Joi provides schema-based validation with detailed error reporting
- Current codebase may have scattered manual validation in route handlers
- Need to ensure Joi is installed and imported properly
- Consider creating a validation middleware wrapper for consistency
- Authentication routes may need special handling for login credentials
- Health check and simple GET endpoints may have minimal validation needs

## Chat Command Log:

- User requested creation of user story for implementing Joi validation everywhere
- Used story template from plan.md
- Included comprehensive acceptance criteria and task breakdown for API endpoint validation
