# User Story: SEC-004 - Implement Request Size Limits

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a system administrator, I want to implement request size limits so that API endpoints validate and restrict payload sizes, preventing abuse and ensuring system stability and security.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Payload size validation is implemented for all incoming requests
- [ ] Request size limits are configurable via environment variables or configuration files
- [ ] Proper error handling returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for oversized requests
- [ ] Validation occurs early in the request processing pipeline for efficiency
- [ ] Limits apply to both JSON payloads and file uploads where applicable
- [ ] Monitoring and logging of oversized request attempts is in place

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Design request size limit configuration
     1. - [ ] Define configuration schema for size limits per endpoint or globally
     2. - [ ] Implement environment variable support for limits
     3. - [ ] Add validation for configuration values

2. - [ ] Implement size validation middleware
     1. - [ ] Create middleware to check Content-Length header
     2. - [ ] Add payload size validation for JSON requests
     3. - [ ] Implement file upload size limits for multipart requests
     4. - [ ] Integrate middleware into API routes

3. - [ ] Add error handling and responses
     1. - [ ] Define error response format for oversized requests
     2. - [ ] Implement proper HTTP status codes (413 Payload Too Large)
     3. - [ ] Add logging for size limit violations

4. - [ ] Test implementation
     1. - [ ] Test size validation with various payload sizes
     2. - [ ] Verify error responses for oversized requests
     3. - [ ] Test configuration changes and reload behavior

5. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document size limit configuration options
     2. - [ ] Update API documentation with size limit information
     3. - [ ] Add developer notes on size limit handling

## Estimation: 8 story points

Story Points: 8 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Implement size validation in middleware for early rejection of oversized requests
- Use Content-Length header for initial checks, but validate actual payload size
- Consider using existing libraries like 'express' body-parser limits or custom implementation
- Ensure limits are configurable and can be updated without code changes
- Log violations for monitoring and security analysis
- Handle both JSON and multipart/form-data requests appropriately
