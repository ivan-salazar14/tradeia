# User Story: SEC-005 - Enhance Password Security Policies

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a security administrator, I want to enhance password security policies so that user accounts are protected against weak passwords, known breaches, and insecure validation practices.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Password complexity requirements are enforced during registration and password changes
- [ ] Breach checking is implemented using a secure API to verify passwords against known data breaches
- [ ] Secure password validation includes strength scoring and feedback to users
- [ ] Password policies are configurable via environment variables or configuration files
- [ ] Proper error messages guide users to create stronger passwords
- [ ] Integration with existing authentication flow without breaking changes

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Design password policy configuration
     1. - [ ] Define complexity rules (length, character types, patterns)
     2. - [ ] Research and select breach checking service/API
     3. - [ ] Design validation feedback system

2. - [ ] Implement complexity validation
     1. - [ ] Create password strength checker utility
     2. - [ ] Add complexity validation to registration endpoint
     3. - [ ] Update password change endpoints with validation

3. - [ ] Integrate breach checking
     1. - [ ] Implement API client for breach checking service
     2. - [ ] Add breach validation to password validation flow
     3. - [ ] Handle API failures gracefully with fallback

4. - [ ] Add secure validation and feedback
     1. - [ ] Implement real-time password strength indicator
     2. - [ ] Add user-friendly error messages and suggestions
     3. - [ ] Ensure validation works across all password input forms

5. - [ ] Test implementation
     1. - [ ] Test complexity requirements with various password types
     2. - [ ] Verify breach checking with known breached passwords
     3. - [ ] Test validation feedback and user experience

6. - [ ] Update documentation
     1. - [ ] Document password policy configuration options
     2. - [ ] Update user-facing documentation on password requirements
     3. - [ ] Add developer notes on password validation implementation

## Estimation: 6 story points

Story Points: 6 (1 SP = 1 day of Human Development = 10 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use a library like 'zxcvbn' for password strength estimation
- Integrate with HaveIBeenPwned API or similar for breach checking
- Ensure client-side validation matches server-side for better UX
- Store hashed passwords securely, validate before hashing
- Consider rate limiting for breach checking API calls
