# User Story: US-016 - Signals Webhook Endpoint

## Status: TODO  
*(Valid values: TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE)*

## Description:

As a system administrator, I want to implement a webhook endpoint that can receive signals from external providers so that signals can be pushed to our system in real-time without polling.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] A secure webhook endpoint is implemented to receive signals
- [ ] Webhook authentication is required using API tokens
- [ ] Signal payload validation ensures data integrity
- [ ] Received signals are immediately processed and stored
- [ ] Webhook activity is logged for auditing purposes
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse of the webhook endpoint

## Task Groups

1. - [ ] Webhook Endpoint Implementation
   1. - [ ] Create webhook API endpoint
   2. - [ ] Implement webhook authentication
   3. - [ ] Add payload validation
   4. - [ ] Create webhook response handling

2. - [ ] Signal Processing Pipeline
   1. - [ ] Implement signal parsing from webhook payload
   2. - [ ] Create signal validation and normalization
   3. - [ ] Add signal storage in Supabase
   4. - [ ] Implement real-time signal distribution

3. - [ ] Webhook Security
   1. - [ ] Add IP whitelisting for webhook sources
   2. - [ ] Implement rate limiting
   3. - [ ] Create webhook signature verification
   4. - [ ] Add request logging and monitoring

4. - [ ] Webhook Management
   1. - [ ] Create webhook configuration interface
   2. - [ ] Implement webhook testing tools
   3. - [ ] Add webhook health monitoring
   4. - [ ] Create webhook documentation for providers

## Estimation: 3 story points

Story Points: 3 SP (3 days of Human Development = 30 minutes of AI development)

## Developer Notes:

- Use HMAC signature verification for webhook security
- Implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate signal processing
- Add comprehensive logging for all webhook requests
- Consider implementing a webhook queue for high traffic periods
- Create clear documentation for signal providers on webhook integration
- Test webhook endpoint with various signal formats and volumes
